* Obstacles
Bugs that take a long time to resolve. Shortcominges in software architecture.

* What happens if one person decides they're ok with a B?
The other two will just work harder.

* Is it acceptable for one or two team members to do more work than the others in the order to get the team an A?
Yes

* When will meetings be held?
Each day in class and in Simmons (we all live in Simmons).

* How will you use in-class time
Designing software architecture. Code reviewing.

* How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class? How long do you anticipate meetings will be?
We'll probably need at least three coding sessions (3 hrs or more) during the week, in addition to class time.

* How will you record and distribute the minutes and action lists produced by each meeting
Harihar will write them in a document during the meeting and put them in the git repo

* How much time do you think this will take?
I'd guess it'll work out to about 20 man-hours a week

* How will work be distributed?
It will depend on people's schedules, interests, and prior knowledge.

* How will deadlines be set?
Based off the class deadlines

* What happens if somebody doesn't meet a deadline or come to a meeting?
They'll be expected to make up for the work and complete their regular assigned work as well.

* How will the work be reviewed?
Code will be reviewed by one other team member

* What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?
If time permits, we will discuss the two options and implement the solution with better quality. If we are behind on our deadlines, we'll just implement the quickest solution that works.

* What will you do if one or more team members are not doing their work?
Kick them off

* How will you deal with work habits of different team members?
Go with the "better" habit (ex. get the work done early instead of late).

* Do you need consensus?
Nah, 2/3 is good

* What do you do if somebody get's fixated on a particular idea?
If time allows, give the person a chance to implement it. If we are behind on the deadlines, we will tell the person to focus on the tasks at hand.
